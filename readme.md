# BlackStar NeoVim Config


## Features
- Basic configuration without abstractions. Meant to be used as a base and hacked into your own perfect config.
- Polished Ranger integration for a more traditional netrw/vim-vinegar like project navigation experience.
- FZF based fuzzy search for project files, project grep, open buffers, and current file find.
- Space leader based workflow with key reference guide as you type (like Spacemacs/SpaceVim).
- Fancy start screen
- Easy ordinal buffer tab navigation with alt+number bindings
- Easy window navigation with numbered windows and <space> number navigation bindings
- <leader> based buffer management tools
- Polished autocomplete and language server integration with CoC
- Multiple Cursors
- Ctag browser and fuzzy search
- Popup windows for an extremely polished workflow
- Robust git integration with both fugitive and lazygit popup integration!
- No side-bar project explorers! (I consider this a feature rather than an omission)
- Toggleable Terminal
- Custom colorscheme throughout the editing and ui elements, with a little extra polishing of javascript, php, and markdown syntax. Inspired by the Lazerwave VSCode theme by Jared Jones: [](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/laserwave).
- Heavy use of NerdFont glyphs to enhance ui and editing.
